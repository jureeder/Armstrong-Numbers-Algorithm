# Armstrong-Numbers-Algorithm

Armstrong numbers are numbers whose digits squared by the number of digits results in a sum equivalent to that number.

For instance, 153 consists of three digits: 

1^3 = 1, 5^3 = 125, 3^3 = 27. 
1 + 125 + 27 = 153.

Thus, 153 is an Armstrong number.


154 also consists of three digits: 

1^3 = 1, 5^3 = 125, 4^3 = 64. 
1 + 125 + 64 = 190.

Thus, 154 is not an Armstrong number.

This C++ algorithm tests every number from 0-10,000 to verify whether it is an Armstrong number.
